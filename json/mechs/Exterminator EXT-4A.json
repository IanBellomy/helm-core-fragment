The primary weapons of the Exterminator are four Averell Highpoint Medium Lasers, two of each in either arm. For long range engagements, the 'Mech also carries a Deadeye-10 LRM-10 launcher with one ton of reloads in the center torso. These weapons are backed up by a single Dinatech Mark III Small Laser mounted in the head for when engagements close to point blank range, and, for defense against missile attacks, the Exterminator has a Buzzsaw Anti-Missile System in the right torso with one ton of ammo.[7][8]","deployment":"All over the place.","designation":"Exterminator EXT-4A","validMTF":true}

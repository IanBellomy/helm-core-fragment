Irian BattleMechs Unlimited was able to fulfill initial orders quicker then anticipated.  This caused concern in the Quartermaster Command despite the mech meeting the SLDF requirements.  These suspicions were confirmed as many of the initial run mechs had unresolved issues with their electronics that made the targeting system all but useless.  While the problem was eventually discovered and rectified the time needed by technicians was not insignificant.","capabilities":" Once the glitch with the original Alexis Photon Target Acquisition System was sorted out the system proved popular with technicians as the way it functioned actually reduced wear and tear on the laser systems.","deployment":" The Hermes popularity ensured it was always a rare mech in comparison to it's contemporaries.  Despite this the Succession Wars ensured that the Hermes proliferated to the other realms and saw heavy use.  Despite Irian producing the Hermes II during the Succession Wars enough secondary manufacturers and storehouses of Hermes ensured that combat loses of the Hermes never resulted in it becoming an extinct design.","designation":"Hermes HER-1B","validMTF":true}

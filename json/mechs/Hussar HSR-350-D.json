It gained such popularity due to it's combination of heavy firepower and unmatched ground mobility, making it one of the most elusive mechs in the SLDF's arsenal to pin down despite it's lack of jump jets.  The original role of supporting infantry units was quickly set aside once the Hussar proved that it was more than able to act as a highly mobile support unit.  This lead to it being often partnered with the Thorn in many formations.","capabilities":" The Hussar's ability to redirect to where support was needed and outrun any of it's contemporaries earned it an largely positive reputation.  The lack of armor still left some pilots unsure of the design but despite this an early battle report from an incident on Wotan in 2630 saw the Hussar deployed in small numbers against superior enemy forces and able to achieve great success despite considerable loses.","deployment":" While the Hussar's mobility allows it to be used in the role of scouting the lack of armor and ability to cause so much havoc behind enemy lines mean it is better suited as a raider.","designation":"Hussar HSR-350-D","validMTF":true}

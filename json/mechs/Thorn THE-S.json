According to survivng records from the period the Thorn was the first to mount Endo Steel II internal structure.  This allowed the design to save significant weight in it's chasis at the expense of increased bulk taking up what would otherwise be valuable space for additional equipment.","capabilities":" Reviews of the Thorn have always been mixed.  Hefty firepower for a design of the mass range won it many supporters but many commanders and mechwarriors found the lack of jump jets a significant drawback when the Thorn was forced into roles it was ill suited for.  This was compounded with only modest ground mobility for a unit of the Thorn's mass.  During the height of the Star League where there were enough mechs to fill the roles that the Thorn was poorly suited to this drawback was largely overlooked.","deployment":" Best suited to being a reasonably mobile firesupport design the Thorn was often teamed with Hussars during the Star League era.","designation":"Thorn THE-S","validMTF":true}
